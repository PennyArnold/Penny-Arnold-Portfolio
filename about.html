                        <p class="text-justify">I grew up in Texas and I am a true Southern girl.  You will figure that out after a few seconds of hearing me talk.  My southern draw is more of an East Texas twang. It's aweful! I moved to Austin in 1996 and it is much more progressive than my little town. Unfortunately, the mix of interesting and charming multi-cultural accents that inundate me every day has not managed to rub off on me much.  I still sound like I am from that little town.</p>  
                        <p class="text-justify">I fell in love and got married in 1991 to my much-better-half and in 1996, we moved from Spring to Austin where I worked as an Aviation Insurance Broker and continued my education at University of Texas.  After graduating with a B.S. in Communications, I had twins and quit work for a while to focus on raising babies. In 2006, I started a career as a technical writer contracting with the State of Texas.  In 2012, I had another baby and shortly after started contracting with the State on a part-time basis.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">In my spare time, I enjoy many passions.  I have been learning from, mentoring and encouraging women since 2007. In 2009, I began leading a weekly women's group where we share our burdens, encourage each other, and build one another up in love. It is a beautiful environment where we can grow in our relationship with God, ourselves, and others.</p> 
                        <p class="text-justify">Another passion - I have been working with middle and high school students for seven years. Currently, I lead a group of 11th grade girls, meeting once a week. I also lead high school students on summer mission trips where we have the honor of stepping outside of ourselves and serving others who are often overlooked and desperately in need of love, resources and encouragement.  Each summer, I lead camp.  I, along with 300 middle and high school students, pile on busses and drive 24 hours to spend a week in Estes Park, Colorado. It is crazy and more fun than you can imagine!</p> 
                        <p class="text-justify">All in all, I love my life.  I love my family, my neighborhood, my friends, strangers - most everyone who crosses my path.  I have learned that everyone is precious and has value, and I look for the best in others.  It isn't hard to find something beautiful in every person.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">My vision is to empower others to find their passion in life and pursue it.  Many just need direction and encouragement to find purpose and passion.  Once that is established, I work to create websites that reflect the individual's vision.  As a creative writer, I put each person's personality on the page so that others see their strengths and unique abilities.  I also help them establish clarity as we work together to formulate a plan to reach their target audience and inspire others to join them in their business or humanitarian endeavor. This looks very different for each client.  We may be inviting the viewer to purchase products, join a cause, or to be encouraged visiting their website.</p> 
                        <p class="text-justify">As it is vital that we continue to grow and learn, I walk alongside each client and work with them as their business or non-profit blossoms and momentum takes them to a new level of growth. This includes redefining goals and providing suggestions for process improvement.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">The relationship that I develop with each client is inspiring, not because I am special, but because  <i>they</i> are special.  The process of building a dream with someone is an amazing ride, full of  obstacles (which we overcome together), but also love, joy and laughter.</p>
                        <p class="text-justify">If you are ready to embark on a new and beautiful journey, don't wait.  Don't rationalize.  Don't talk yourself out of it.  Act on it!  Dare to dream again and take the first step in making it happen.</p>
